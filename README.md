# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


This was the first website i made for my work. i quickly decided i didnt like it but instead of getting rid of it and starting over using the same react/vite file - i initialized another project to commemorate this one. Its not a great website because it was one of my first where i had free reign to design it how i wanted but im proud of it nonetheless.
